Part I - Describe all Joins


    1. INNER JOIN - Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
       It joins two tables on the basis of the column which is explicitly specified in the ON clause. 
	 
    2. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
	Those with no matching values from the right table are returned as NULL in the result-set.
    3. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
	Those with no matching values from the left table are returned as NULL in the result-set.
    4. FULL (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.  
    5. SELF JOIN - the same table is joined to itself and are distinguished from each other by giving each table an alias.
    6. NATURAL JOIN - joins two tables based on the same column names and datatypes. 
       The resulting table will contain all the columns of both tables, keeping only one copy of the common column/s.

PART II - 
A left join is used, where the vendor_table is the left table and the yarn_table is the right table. 
All records from the left table are returned, along with the matching records from the right table.
Any records from the vendor-table with no corresponding matching record from the right table is returned
as NULL in the result-set.
